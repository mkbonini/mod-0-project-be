## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

>My typical way to ask a question is to first research what I can and then try to ask the question and include what I think is the answer.  I usually do think to ensure I am on the right track before committing but I also think it can be a way to avoid looking foolish asking a "dumb question".  I do not believe I am bad at asking questions I think I struggle more with constructing them.
