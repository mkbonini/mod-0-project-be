## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  * I think something I do well is to seek challenge and believe that I can figure it out or learn what I need to.  I have never been afraid to try something new and have a belief in myself that I can figure it out with time.

  * some things I never associated with having a growth mindset were giving yourself time to reflect and be patient.  We are not learning a skill with a hard end or goal. I will always be learning and developing and I will need to be ok with that.  I feel like I am trying to rush to know how to code, but I will never truly know everything and will always be learning.  I think this is a much more healthy mindset that I can work to have.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * As stated above, I love to take on a new challenge and I am ok with not having all the answers before I start. I believe that I can learn and grow to meet a challenge.

  * I can be hard on myself when I am not good at things after trying them or when they don't come naturally to me. I need to work on the mentality that with time and practice I can improve and just be comfortable with where I am.  I think this deals directly with comparing myself to others who have likely been doing it for longer or are more naturally predisposed to something.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  a conditional statement is a statement or often a block of code that works only if certain prerequisites or conditions are met first.  EX:
    1. if statements
        if x > 10
              do something
        end
    2. if-else statements
        if x > 10
                do something
        else
                do something else
        end
    3. if-elseif-else statements
        if x > 10
                do something
        elsif x > 5
                do a second thing instead
        else
                do something crazy
        end
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

* if statements are useful when you need a program to make a decision based of data, variables, or user input. for example if you know or ask for a users age you can decide if it is appropriate to display certain information if there age is above a certain limit.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

  ```ruby
    if true
          #some code goes Here
    end
  ```
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

*  with the and (&&) or or (||) operators

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```ruby
    if x > 10
            #do something
    elsif x > 5
          #  do a second thing instead
    else
          #  do something crazy
    end
  ```
